### Background 背景

> 12 月后培训结束,我开始找工作. 坦白说我很害怕找工作,过去的一个星期我都不知道要怎么开始这件事情,现在我找到了一个办法,我给自己定下面试 99 家公司并且失败的目标,然后在第 100 家公司的时候面试成功.在这个过程中,我要磨练我的面试技巧.

- 具体怎么做呢,我会积极准备面试,因为要失败,所以我不会害怕,我尽量展示我自己.面试结束后,我会积极和 HR 沟通,询问他们我做的好的地方和做不好的地方.像招聘从业者学习,应该是我能掌握并学会的比较快的学习方法了.为了能进面试,我要:

  1.  准备简历(投出去看看有没有回复,5 家公司一个单位)
  2.  准备一些常见的面试问题,然后练习回答.

> I am afraid of job hunting because of some past experience, and now it is time for me to get rid of it. So let me fail often in order to success only once. I planned to fail 99 interviews and success in the last one.I want to master the art of interview during this long-run project.

- How can I achieve my plan? I will not be afraid, and I will show who I am to to team, and I will get feedback from HR that interviewed me and learn from that. That is the most efficient way to learn how to practice an interview.

> Let me act now even though my actions may not bring happiness or success for it is better to act and fail than not to act and flounder. --- by OG Mandino<!-- prettier-ignore -->
