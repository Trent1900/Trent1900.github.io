- video scr can not be loaded

- it turns out to be the git ignore file, coz during testing period, I do not to upload my testing video to git hub due to the size of it, so I put ".mp4" keyword in the ignore file, so that all mp4 file will be ignored and not up load to cloud.
- and works only in local environment.

- to add a preview of the video, simply just add `poster='/images/poster.png'` to `video` tag.
