### 3D

> `transform-style: flat` vs `transform-style: preserve-3d` refer to [link](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/trycss3_transform-style_inuse.htm)<!-- prettier-ignore -->

- The transform-style CSS property sets whether **children** of an element are positioned in the 3D space or are flattened in the plane of the element, in short, `preserve-3d` 可以立体穿透。

- Each 3D element with z>0 becomes larger; each 3D-element with z<0 becomes smaller. The strength of the effect is determined by the value of this property. Large values of `perspective` cause a small transformation; small values of `perspective` cause a large transformation, to sum up,`perspective` defines how far the object is away from the user.
