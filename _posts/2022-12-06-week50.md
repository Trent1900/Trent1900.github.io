## Weekly forecast

{:.prompt-tip}

### AWS charge me on EC2 $14

> Tips: EC2 offer 750 hours for free tier user, which is bigger than 24\*31 = 744 hours<!-- prettier-ignore -->
{:.prompt-info}
> After checking and same researches, I opened 2 EC2 instances running the whole month. One of them is set up before moving house, and the other one set up by Tutor during his Lecture, and I volunteered to participate his demo practice for CI/CD.

> In AWS codePipeLine, deploy the repo to elastic beanstalk(env created automatically) <!-- prettier-ignore -->
{:.prompt-info}

> add unsafe-perm for aws permission in .npmrc file<!-- prettier-ignore -->
{:.prompt-info}

> difference between Elastic Beanstalk and Amplify [check this link](https://blog.back4app.com/aws-amplify-vs-beanstalk/)

> deploy on AWS amplify while having issue with cross-origin , refer to console error below:

```console
The page at '<URL>' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource '<URL>'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
```

This is because of the weather request is set as http instead of https. change it to https, and test in Postman, that works, so push to GitHub.

> Route 53 cost $0.50 per hosted zone / month for the first 25 hosted zones
