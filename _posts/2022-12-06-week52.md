### node-fetch issue

> latest version of node-fetch(as Dec 2022 version 3.30) does not support import with 'require'<!-- prettier-ignore -->
{:.prompt-info}

- need to to :
  1. change to version 2 with npm i node-fetch@2, then use require, or
  2. use axios instead of fetch, or
  3. change other require to import with add "type" : "module" in package.json (do not forget to npm install)

### google map API best practice

> For google map that needs to be rendered in frontend, a restricted API Key is recommended to be used, refer to [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38153734/do-i-need-to-hide-api-key-when-using-google-maps-js-api-if-so-how)<!-- prettier-ignore -->
{:.prompt-info}

- You can create multiple API keys with different restrictions to use them safely. For embedding a map, the Google Maps documentation has instructions for creating a correctly restricted API key so that it cannot be abused for other purposes at Get an API Key - Restricting API keys. It's OK to include a restricted API key in your source code, because you cannot embed a map properly without doing that anyway.
